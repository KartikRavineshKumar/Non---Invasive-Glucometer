The dataset has 602 columns where voltages from sensor 1 is from 1 to 201 readings, sensor 2 is from 202 to 403 and sensor 3 is from 403 to 602. The dataset had 461 patients and after omitting the patients which didnâ€™t have the ads1115 output a dataset with 437 patients was left.
The dataset was then randomly divided into 80 percent and 20 percent where 80 percent was for training and 20 percent was for testing data. 
The model was trained using the all the optimizable app from the three families.
Ensemble Model gives the best for phase 1 normalized dataset with RMSE value of 3.39 for test data.
