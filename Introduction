The need to create an NIG prototype with greater accuracy and precision is the driving force behind this endeavor. This research aims to improve user accessibility and glucose level measurement speed. Since diabetes affects 463 million people worldwide, it's important to address its complications, including renal failure, cerebrovascular accidents, myocardial infarctions, and visual impairment. 
Diabetes directly kills 1.5 million people in 2019 and raises early death rates by 5%, so we need better solutions now. Diabetes is expected to impact 578 million people by 2030. 
Current NIGs fail to address needs and gaps include reading accuracy, ease of use, hygiene, and medical resource waste. Glucowatch was a non-invasive glucose tester. This gadget monitors glucose from undamaged skin using an amperometric biosensor. Clinical trials show that the biography produces more accurate glucose values than fingerstick blood glucose measures. Home readings differed by 0.26 mmol/L on average. Biographers' Clarke Error Grid results were clinically acceptable A+B in almost 94% of cases. Low glucose levels modestly raise biographer readings. Biographer precision is about 10%, according to CV. The biographer's low glucose alert function detected 75% of hypoglycemia events with few false alerts. Only minor skin irritation—redness and swelling—was present in patients. In most cases, the discomfort resolved without treatment after a few days. 
Occlusion Spectroscopy, another non-invasive glucose test, was performed in a controlled laboratory and showed a significant correlation between estimated and real glucose levels. The clinical experiment recorded 1690 paired glucose levels from non-invasive blood samples to a reference standard. The reference glucose range in the paired data set was 40–496 mg/dl. No bias was found at glucose levels 70, 100, 150, and 200 mg/dl. Average relative absolute difference was 17.2%. A Clarke error grid analysis showed 95.5% of readings were clinically acceptable A&B. Zone A had 69.7% of readings and Zone B 25.7%. Despite impressive findings, the equipment was not portable or easy to use. 

Another approach to detect glucose in urine used samples from a healthy 25-year-old male stored at 3°C. 
To quantify glucose in urine (0–20 mg/mL), GOx-functionalized PAni paper was used. In order to measure, 10 mL of urine solution was pipetted onto the PAni or RPAni paper sensors. The naked eye noted the color transformation of PAni and RPAni paper sensors from emerald blue to green within seconds, just as the wavelength increased to 600 nm. PAni-NPs are doped in the ES state at pH 2. Benzenoid rings exhibit absorbance peaks for the π.π* transition and polaron band transitions at 430 and 600 nm. PAni-NPs enter the EB state, which is less doped, as pH rises. This leads to a constant decrease in absorbance at 430 nm and an increase at 600. The calibration plot was linear from pH 2 to 8. A high linear correlation of 0.9667 was found. This suggests that PAni-NPs could accurately detect glucose in urine in varied pH conditions [4]. also used PAni sheets, which would be discarded after testing, and also handled urine samples, which could cause public hygiene issues. 
The prototype version 3.0 will use NIR spectroscopy with higher wavelength sensors to penetrate deep tissues through the fingertips. The Raspberry Pi 5 microprocessor is the latest and best, improving processing speed. NIR sensors may eliminate finger sticks and CGM implantation. Also, eliminate needle-induced pain, prevent erroneous findings from hand contamination, and reduce waste from disposable testing products like test strips or lancets. 
NIR spectroscopic technologies overcome conventional spectroscopic systems' bulkiness, cost, complexity, and online detection issues. After preprocessing the original spectra, we used two feature extraction algorithms, synergy interval (Si) and genetic algorithm (GA), to see if NIRS can accurately measure blood glucose levels without invasive procedures. Based on this basis, partial least squares (PLS) and extreme learning machine (ELM) quantitative prediction models were created. The Si-GA-ELM model, which combines Si, GA, and ELM, was the most accurate tested model. Meanwhile, the spectral waveband outperformed the complete waveband in prediction accuracy. We used TrAdaBoost model transfer to increase our model's precision and consistency in a restricted sample data model and reduce individual variances. Experiments show that the NIR spectrometer used is portable and lightweight, allowing it to be handed. Computation models that combine machine learning and chemometrics make blood glucose estimation easier. This revolutionizes non-invasive blood glucose testing.
